Module 19 - Deep Learning 

## Project Overview

vhgvbv

#### Deliverable 1

- [x] 1. The EIN and NAME columns have been dropped
- [x] 2. The columns with more than 10 unique values have been grouped together
- [x] 3. The categorical variables have been encoded using one-hot encoding
- [x] 4. The preprocessed data is split into features and target arrays
- [x] 5. The preprocessed data is split into training and testing datasets
- [x] 6. The numerical values have been standardized using the StandardScaler() module


#### Deliverable 2

- [x] 1. The number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and activation function are defined
- [x] 2. An output layer with an activation function is created
- [x] 3. There is an output for the structure of the model
- [x] 4. There is an output of the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy
- [x] 5. The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs
- [x] 6. The results are saved to an HDF5 file

#### Deliverable 3

The model is optimized, and the predictive accuracy is increased to over 75%, or there is working code that makes three attempts to increase model performance using the following steps:
- [x] 1. Noisy variables are removed from features
- [x] 2. Additional neurons are added to hidden layers
- [x] 3. Additional hidden layers are added
- [x] 4. The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization
- [x] 5. The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs
- [x] 6. The results are saved to an HDF5 file

#### Deliverable 4

- [x] 1. There is a title, and there are multiple sections
- [x] 2. Each section has a heading and subheading
- [x] 3. Links to images are working, and code is formatted and displayed correctly
- [x] 4. The purpose of this analysis is well defined
- [x] 5. There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions
- [x] 6. There is a summary of the results
- [x] 7. There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification



## Resources

- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.58.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0


## Results

3-
Optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75% by using any or all of the following:

Adjusting the input data to ensure that there are no variables or outliers that are causing confusion in the model, such as:
Dropping more or fewer columns.
Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
Adding more neurons to a hidden layer.
Adding more hidden layers.
Using different activation functions for the hidden layers.
Adding or reducing the number of epochs to the training regimen.
